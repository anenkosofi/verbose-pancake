        <p class="about__overview">
          Many have heard the advice to avoid grocery shopping when you’re hungry, because it leads to poor choices. The
          same
          holds true for furniture stores – don’t go shopping in a panic, just because you have an empty home. Yes, you
          need a
          sofa. But if you pick the pink-striped sectional just because you like it in the store, without taking
          measurements or
          thinking about the rest of the room, you’re stuck with it. The rest of the room will have to be built around
          that sofa,
          and if it’s too large for the space it will look forever awkward.

          Start in the room you’re looking to furnish, armed with a measuring tape and a notepad.
